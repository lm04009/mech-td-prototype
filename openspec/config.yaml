schema: spec-driven

# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
context: |
    Tech stack: JavaScript (ES6 Modules), HTML5 Canvas, CSS3
    
    CRITICAL PROJECT RULES:
    1. Zero Tolerance for Deviation
       - NEVER assume a working prototype is "good enough" if it deviates from the agreed-upon plan or spec.
       - ALWAYS flag deviations immediately.
       - If code disagrees with spec, STOP and ask: "Align Code to Spec OR Align Spec to Code?"
    
    2. Verification is Mandatory
       - Verification steps in OpenSpec workflow are REQUIRED.
       - Never ask to skip verification.
       - Always perform steps defined in tasks.md.

    3. Screenshot Protocol (BINDING)
       - Phase 1: Analyze & Acknowledge (Describe what you see first).
       - Phase 2: Confirm Understanding (Wait for user confirmation).
       - Phase 3: Action (Proceed only after confirmation).
       - FAILURE CONDITION: If you cannot see/read the screenshot, STOP IMMEDIATELY.

constraints:
  - "NEVER solve a logic problem by deleting or bypassing existing features"
  - "All new features must be modular. Hard-coding values or logic into specific instances is strictly prohibited."
  - "Assume all systems will scale. For example, an enemy attack system must support N-types of enemies and M-types of projectiles by default."
  - "Before providing the code, list three edge cases for this feature and explain how your proposed architecture handles them without breaking existing systems."
# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
