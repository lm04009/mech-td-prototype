# Project Rules

1.  **Screenshot Protocol**: When the user provides a screenshot:
    *   **Phase 1: Analysis**: You MUST first acknowledge receipt and describe exactly what you see and its relevance to the task.
    *   **Phase 2: Confirmation**: Present this analysis to the user and **WAIT** for explicit confirmation.
    *   **Phase 3: Action**: Only *after* confirmation may you proceed with thinking or changes.
    *   **Critical Failure**: If you cannot see, access, or understand the screenshot, you MUST **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and alert the user. Do not proceed based on assumptions.
    *   **Binding**: This rule is absolute and has the highest priority.

2.  **Verification**: Always verify changes manually or with tests before marking a task as complete.
